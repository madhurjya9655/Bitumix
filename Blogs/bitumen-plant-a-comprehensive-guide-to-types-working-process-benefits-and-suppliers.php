            <!-- Types of Bitumen Plants -->
            <div class="content-block mb-5">
                <h2 class="section-title">Types of Bitumen Plants</h2>
                <p>
                    There are two main types of bitumen plants: stationary and mobile. Stationary plants are fixed installations suitable for large-scale projects with higher production capacities. Mobile plants are portable, ideal for smaller projects and remote locations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Modern plants address environmental concerns with low NOx burners, dust collection systems, and recycling mechanisms, ensuring compliance with sustainability goals.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Working Process -->
            <div class="content-block mb-5">
                <h2 class="section-title">Working Process of Bitumen Plants</h2>
                <p>
                    Bitumen plants operate by heating and mixing raw materials to produce asphalt. Key steps include bitumen refining, which removes impurities from crude bitumen, and the integration of recycling systems to minimize raw material and energy consumption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Advanced technologies like dust collectors and air pollution control devices mitigate environmental impacts, ensuring sustainable operations.
