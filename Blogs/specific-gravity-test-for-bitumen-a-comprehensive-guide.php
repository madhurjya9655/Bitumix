                <h2 class="section-title">The Importance of Specific Gravity in Bitumen Testing</h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding specific gravity in bitumen testing is essential for assessing quality and performance. It is critical in asphalt production for determining mix proportions and achieving desired performance. Specific gravity also influences the stability and load-bearing capacity of pavements, helping engineers design safer and longer-lasting roads.

            <!-- Test Procedure -->
            <div class="content-block mb-5">
                <h2 class="section-title">Understanding the Specific Gravity Test Procedure</h2>
                <p>
                    The specific gravity of bitumen is determined using a pycnometer. The process involves weighing the empty pycnometer, filling it with a known volume of bitumen, and weighing it again. The specific gravity is then calculated by dividing the bitumen weight by the weight of an equal volume of water.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Limitations include a lack of chemical composition data, susceptibility to temperature variations, and possible contamination. This test should be supplemented with other assessments for a complete analysis of bitumen properties.
                </p>

            <!-- Factors Affecting Specific Gravity -->
            <div class="content-block mb-5">
                <h2 class="section-title">Factors Affecting Specific Gravity of Bitumen</h2>
                <p>
                    Temperature and composition are two critical factors influencing specific gravity:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Higher temperatures reduce bitumen density and specific gravity, while lower temperatures increase both.</li>
                    <li><strong>Composition:</strong> The content of hydrocarbons, asphaltenes, and aromatics in bitumen also affects specific gravity. Higher asphaltene content results in a higher specific gravity, while higher aromatic content lowers it.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
